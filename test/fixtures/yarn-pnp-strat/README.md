# Simple Project

A bread-and-butter project with a `pglt.toml` on top level and SQL files in the `test` folder. The extension is installed via Yarn Plug'n'Play.

## Prerequesites

Make sure you have `yarn` installed. Run `yarn set version 4.5.0` to use this package's yarn version.

## Expectations

The extension should recognize the `pglt.toml` file and connect with the right database. We shouldn't have to install a global binary.

## Test protocol
